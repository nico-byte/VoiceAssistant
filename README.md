This is the first year project for my second semester in AI and cognitive systems. I'm working on this with 2 other dudes from my courses.

The core features would be an integrateion of openai whisper and chat gpt, originally we wanted to create an note application that transforms audio input into
notes. Now we further want to add an chatgpt integration. This works over the open ai api. We have some safety issues in the user creation process - everything is saved on the cellphone itself without any encryption or database, but we don't need any security geatures for our purposes. It#s just a demo for presentation purposes.
